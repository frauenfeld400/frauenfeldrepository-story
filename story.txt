	John was a man who liked to fish. He traded his fish down by the
docks for money to buy better fishing rods. One day, he lost all of his fish
and fishing rods while fishing in a storm. He spent more money to get more 
fishing rods, but he lost those in the water too, because he tried to go
and fish his rods and fish out in the storm again.
