	John was a man who liked to fish. He traded his fish down by the
docks for money to buy better fishing rods. One day, he lost all of his fish
and fishing rods while fishing in a storm. He spent more money to get more 
fishing rods, but he lost those in the water too, because he tried to go
and fish his rods and fish out in the storm again.
	John then tried to swim down to get back all his fishing rods, but John
didn't get very far and found no fishing rods. John was very upset that he had
lost all his fish and all his fishing rods and tackle. He decided to sit on
the beach and think about what to do.   
	After his unsuccesful attempts to retrive his fishing rods, he got up 
from the beach and went back to the store. He decided to get another fishing rod
one last time. He got the most expensive one that couldn't break and could catch
the largest fish. He decided this new rod would surely turn his luck around.
	But the store scammed John and he lost all his money. John then didn't have anything left in his possession so he had to resort to politics. He argued for the better good for the community. Without giving any specifics on his policies, he became the president then retired after the first day.
